## üëã Welcome to the DeFiActions Scaffold

This repository is a scaffold for building with Flow Actions (DeFiActions) and includes AI-friendly guidance for composing safe Cadence transactions from standardized connectors.

- **What‚Äôs included**:
  - Minimal Flow project with dependencies for DeFiActions and IncrementFi connectors
  - Example transaction: Claim ‚Üí Zap ‚Üí Restake for IncrementFi LP rewards
  - Cursor rules context for DeFiActions; helpful for agent-assisted development ([Cursor Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules))

## üî® Prerequisites

- Flow CLI: install from the [Flow CLI docs](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/install)
- VS Code + Cadence extension (recommended): [Cadence Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onflow.cadence)

## üì¶ Project Structure

- `flow.json` ‚Äì Project configuration with DeFiActions/IncrementFi dependencies
- `cadence/contracts/` ‚Äì Example contract (Counter)
- `cadence/scripts/` ‚Äì Example read-only script
- `cadence/transactions/` ‚Äì Transactions, including the IncrementFi restake example
- `cadence/tests/` ‚Äì Example tests

Key example:
- `cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc` ‚Äì Claims IncrementFi farm rewards, zaps to LP, and restakes back into the same pool using DeFiActions connectors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

You can run locally on the emulator or target testnet/mainnet. String-based imports resolve when the target network is running and dependencies are deployed or aliased in `flow.json`.

### Install Cadence dependencies (required)

Install all declared dependencies from `flow.json` right after cloning locally:
```bash
flow deps install
```
See the Flow CLI Dependency Manager docs for details: [Dependency Manager](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/dependency-manager).

### Option A: Emulator (local)

1) Start the emulator (terminal A):
```bash
flow emulator
```

2) Deploy configured contracts (terminal B):
```bash
flow project deploy --network emulator
```

Notes:
- This deploys the dependencies listed under `deployments.emulator` in `flow.json` to the local dev account.
- Some protocol state (pairs/pools) may not exist on emulator by default; transactions that depend on live IncrementFi state may require custom local bootstrap.

### Option B: Testnet (recommended for live protocol state)

1) Create or configure a testnet account in `flow.json` (or via `flow accounts create --network testnet`).
2) Ensure dependencies in `flow.json` include `testnet` aliases (this scaffold includes many prefilled).
3) No local deploy is required for contracts that already exist on testnet; imports use the configured addresses.

## üîß Deploying connectors

- **Emulator (local)**: Contracts listed under `deployments.emulator` in `flow.json` (e.g., `DeFiActions`, `IncrementFiStakingConnectors`, `IncrementFiPoolLiquidityConnectors`, `SwapConnectors`, `Staking`, etc.) are deployed to your local dev account when you run:
```bash
flow project deploy --network emulator
```
If you restart the emulator, redeploy.

- **Testnet/Mainnet**: Connectors are already deployed and referenced via `dependencies.aliases` in `flow.json`. You usually do not deploy them yourself. If you maintain custom forks, update `flow.json` aliases and deploy with your signer.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Prepare your account

- **Emulator**: Use the built-in `emulator-account` (pre-funded). No action needed.
- **Testnet**:
  1) Create an account:
     ```bash
     flow accounts create --network testnet
     ```
  2) Add a signer alias in `flow.json` under `accounts` with its address and key file:
     ```json
     {
       "accounts": {
         "testnet-account": {
           "address": "<YOUR_TESTNET_ADDRESS>",
           "key": { "type": "file", "location": "testnet-account.pkey" }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
  3) Fund it via the Testnet Faucet: [testnet-faucet.onflow.org](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org)
- **Mainnet**:
  1) Add your mainnet account to `flow.json` under `accounts` (address + key file or env). Docs: [Flow CLI Accounts](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/accounts) | [Keys](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/keys)
  2) Ensure sufficient FLOW for fees and storage. See [Fees](https://developers.flow.com/build/basics/fees) and your wallet provider.

Protocol requirement:
- Ensure the signer has `Staking.UserCertificate` at `Staking.UserCertificateStoragePath`. If already staking in the target IncrementFi pool, you likely have one; otherwise follow the IncrementFi staking docs to initialize it.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the IncrementFi Restake Transaction

Transaction: `cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc`

Purpose:
- Claim pending farm rewards ‚Üí Zap to LP ‚Üí Stake LP back to the same pool

Parameters:
- `pid: UInt64` ‚Äì IncrementFi pool ID

Emulator example (after deploy):
```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc \
  --network emulator \
  --signer emulator-account \
  --args-json '[{"type":"UInt64","value":"1"}]'
```

Testnet example (replace `testnet-account` with your signer alias):
```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc \
  --network testnet \
  --signer testnet-account \
  --args-json '[{"type":"UInt64","value":"<POOL_PID>"}]'
```

Mainnet example (replace `mainnet-account` with your signer alias):
```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc \
  --network mainnet \
  --signer mainnet-account \
  --args-json '[{"type":"UInt64","value":"<POOL_PID>"}]'
```

Requirements:
- Signer must have `Staking.UserCertificate` at `Staking.UserCertificateStoragePath`.
- `pid` must be a valid pool with rewards and a corresponding pair.
- Ensure `flow deps install` has been run after cloning so string-based imports resolve via `flow.json` aliases.
- On mainnet, ensure your signer has sufficient FLOW for tx and storage; verify connector addresses match `flow.json` dependencies.

## üß≠ DeFiActions Composition (quick reference)

Minimal restake flow connectors used in `cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc`:
- Source: `IncrementFiStakingConnectors.PoolRewardsSource`
- Swapper: `IncrementFiPoolLiquidityConnectors.Zapper` (token types and `stableMode` from pair)
- SwapSource: `SwapConnectors.SwapSource(swapper, source)`
- Sink: `IncrementFiStakingConnectors.PoolSink`

String-based imports are used throughout (see file for full example). Safety invariants: size withdraws by sink capacity, assert residuals, single-expression pre/post.

## üí¨ Example AI prompts
- "Create me a Cadence transaction which restakes my Increment Fi LP token staking rewards"
- "Generate a minimal restake transaction using DeFiActions connectors (PoolRewardsSource ‚Üí Zapper via SwapSource ‚Üí PoolSink) with string imports and safety invariants"
- "Compose a SwapSource from PoolRewardsSource and IncrementFiPoolLiquidityConnectors.Zapper, then stake to IncrementFiStakingConnectors.PoolSink with pre/post checks and residual assertion"
- "Add a post condition verifying the stake increased by the expected zapper.quoteOut amount"

## üß™ Testing

Run Cadence tests:
```bash
flow test
```

Lint a transaction:
```bash
flow cadence lint cadence/transactions/IncrementFi_Restake.cdc --network emulator
```

Note on checks: static checks that resolve imports require the target network to be up and/or contracts deployed. Prefer running against `--network testnet` for live protocol state.
